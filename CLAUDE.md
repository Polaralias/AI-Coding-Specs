# Claude Agent Guide

Begin with `ai-specs/specs/base-standards.mdc` for the universal rules. After that, jump to the standards relevant to your assignment:
- Backend or API changes: `ai-specs/specs/backend-standards.mdc`.
- Frontend/React updates: `ai-specs/specs/frontend-standards.mdc`.
- Android/Kotlin work: `ai-specs/specs/android-standards.mdc`.
- AI tooling or automation: `ai-specs/specs/ai-tools-standards.mdc`.
- Documentation edits: `ai-specs/specs/documentation-standards.mdc`.

Use this guide to find the right `.mdc` files; those documents contain the enforceable standards.
