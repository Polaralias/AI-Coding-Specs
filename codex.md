# Codex Agent Guide

Start with `ai-specs/specs/base-standards.mdc`. It contains the full navigation for all domain-specific `.mdc` files (backend, frontend, Android, AI tools, documentation). Apply every linked standard that matches your work.

This file is reserved for any Codex-specific repo guidance; if none is present, rely entirely on the `.mdc` documents.
