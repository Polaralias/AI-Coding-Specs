# Codex Agent Guide

Start by reading `ai-specs/specs/base-standards.mdc`, which applies to every task. Then consult the standards that match the work you are doing:
- Backend or API changes: `ai-specs/specs/backend-standards.mdc`.
- Frontend/React updates: `ai-specs/specs/frontend-standards.mdc`.
- Android/Kotlin work: `ai-specs/specs/android-standards.mdc`.
- AI tooling or automation: `ai-specs/specs/ai-tools-standards.mdc`.
- Documentation edits: `ai-specs/specs/documentation-standards.mdc`.

Use this file only as a directory—follow the linked `.mdc` files for the complete rules.
