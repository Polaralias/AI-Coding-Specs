# Agent Onboarding Guide

This repository uses Markdown Concept (`.mdc`) files under `ai-specs/specs` as the source of truth for coding standards. Start every task by reviewing `ai-specs/specs/base-standards.mdc`, then follow the agent-specific file (for example, `codex.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, or `GEMINI.md`) for the next documents to read.

When applying the standards, pick the `.mdc` files that match the work you are doing:
- `ai-specs/specs/backend-standards.mdc` for backend/Node.js/TypeScript changes.
- `ai-specs/specs/frontend-standards.mdc` for React/frontend changes.
- `ai-specs/specs/android-standards.mdc` for Android/Kotlin changes.
- `ai-specs/specs/ai-tools-standards.mdc` when creating or updating AI tools or automations.
- `ai-specs/specs/documentation-standards.mdc` for any documentation updates.

Use these entries as navigation only—the `.mdc` files hold the full rules.
