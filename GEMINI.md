# Gemini Agent Guide

Start with `ai-specs/specs/base-standards.mdc` to cover the shared rules. Then review the standards that apply to your scope:
- Backend or API changes: `ai-specs/specs/backend-standards.mdc`.
- Frontend/React updates: `ai-specs/specs/frontend-standards.mdc`.
- Android/Kotlin work: `ai-specs/specs/android-standards.mdc`.
- AI tooling or automation: `ai-specs/specs/ai-tools-standards.mdc`.
- Documentation edits: `ai-specs/specs/documentation-standards.mdc`.

Use this file as a map; the linked `.mdc` documents contain the full expectations.
