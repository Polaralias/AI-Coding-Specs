# Gemini Agent Guide

Begin with `ai-specs/specs/base-standards.mdc`. It provides the single source of navigation to all other `.mdc` standards (backend, frontend, Android, AI tools, documentation) that might apply.

This file is reserved for Gemini-specific repo direction; in the absence of extra notes, follow the `.mdc` standards referenced from the base document.
